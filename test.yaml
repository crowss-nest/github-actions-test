    Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife And 
    if it was an open-shut caseI never would've known from that look on your faceLost in your current like a priceless wine
    The more that you sayThe less I know Wherever you strayI followI'm begging for you to take my handWreck my plans
    That's my man
